	<!-- remember:
	
	filesets are your friend
	
	the .xml files in this presentation have comments to help you
	
	the ant manual is separated into Concepts and Types, Core Tasks, and Optional Tasks. If you can't
	find a "tag" (like "<fileset>") in the "Tasks" sections, then it's probably in the Concepts and Types section
	
	There is nothing to be afraid of! Practice with ANT in a directory outside your webroot,
	on dummy files or files you copy from your real apps, and you don't have to worry
	about bustin' your apps.
