This is the source code that supports the Adobe DevNet article series on Test 
Driven Development with ColdFusion by Bill Shelton and Marc Esher of mxunit.org.

The examples for Part 1 of the series are broken up into 2 directories. the 
"good" directory contains the source code that was presented in the article as
verbatim as possible.  The "better" directory contains essentially the same
code, but refactored to be more elegant, and may also have some additional 
goodies.

Running the examples:
To run the examples, you will need to ensure the following:

1. Download and install MXUnit from http://mxunit.org
2. Create an account with Twitter.com and "follow" some people. Note: you can
   use this url to find CF folks : http://search.twitter.com/search?q=coldfusion
3. Create a credentials.txt file with one line : 
     yourTwitterUsername,yourTwitterPassword and place that in the ame directory
     as the TwitterClientTest.cfc
